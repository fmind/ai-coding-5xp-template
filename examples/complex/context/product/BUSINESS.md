# Business Context

This document outlines the core business objectives and target metrics for ActiveGear.

## Core Objectives

- **Market Share**: Establish ActiveGear as the premier online destination for specialized sporting equipment (running, cycling, swimming) in North America.
- **Revenue Growth**: Increase top-line revenue by 30% Year-over-Year, driven by aggressive customer acquisition and expanding the product catalog.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Maximize LTV through loyalty programs, personalized gear recommendations, and exceptional post-purchase support.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Conversion Rate (CVR)**: The percentage of site visitors who complete a purchase. This is the single most important metric for the engineering team to monitor when deploying UI changes.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The goal is to increase AOV through intelligent cross-selling ("Frequently bought together") and up-selling ("Premium version").
- **Cart Abandonment Rate**: A constant focus is reducing the number of users who add items to their cart but fail to complete the checkout process.

## Strategic Initiatives

- **Seasonal Campaigns**: Ensure platform stability and feature readiness for major retail events (Black Friday, Cyber Monday) and seasonal sports launches (Spring running gear, Winter sports).
- **Omnichannel Integration**: Seamlessly bridge the gap between our online platform and physical retail partners (e.g., Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store - BOPIS).
- **Community Building**: Foster brand loyalty by integrating educational content, training plans, and athlete features directly into the shopping experience.
