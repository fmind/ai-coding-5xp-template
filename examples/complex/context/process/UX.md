# User Experience

This document defines the core principles guiding the user interface and interaction design for ActiveGear.

## UX Principles

- **Frictionless Checkout**: Every unnecessary click removed from the purchase path translates directly to increased revenue. Prioritize guest checkout and auto-filling details where possible.
- **Speed is a Feature**: The majority of online shoppers will abandon a site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. Asset optimization and fast page transitions are mandatory.
- **Mobile First**: Over 60% of our traffic originates from mobile devices. All designs must be responsive and optimized for touch interactions (e.g., large tap targets, intuitive swipe gestures).
- **Clear Information Architecture**: Users must be able to navigate a catalog of thousands of items effortlessly. Emphasize robust filtering, sorting, and breadcrumb navigation.

## Visual Design

- **Brand Consistency**: Adhere strictly to the design system (e.g., specific tailwind color palettes, typography) to maintain a cohesive, premium brand image throughout the user journey.
- **High-Quality Imagery**: Product photos are the primary driver of sales. They must be high-resolution, zoomable, and consistently lit, but heavily optimized (WebP format) for web delivery.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Utilize subtle animations (e.g., button hover states, cart adding confirmation flashes) to provide immediate, satisfying feedback without being distracting.

## Accessibility (a11y)

- **Inclusive Design**: ActiveGear believes in sports for everyone. The site must be fully usable by individuals relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation.
- **WCAG Compliance**: Aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. Pay exceptional attention to color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 semantic tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<button>`) to ensure assistive technologies can correctly parse the page structure.
