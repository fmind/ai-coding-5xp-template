# Platform Context

Define the technical foundation so the AI knows exactly what tools and patterns to use.

## Core Technology Stack

- Languages: Programming languages and target versions
- Tooling: Package managers, build tools, and runtimes
- Backend: Frameworks for server-side rendering and APIs
- Frontend: Component frameworks, UI libraries, and rendering
- Database & Storage: Primary databases, ORMs, and object storage

## Architecture & Patterns

- Data flow: e.g., Event-driven, synchronous, batch processing
- Design patterns: e.g., Repository pattern, Dependency Injection
- State management: e.g., Server-state vs client-state approaches
- System architecture: e.g., Monolithic, Microservices, Serverless
- Service communication: e.g., RESTful endpoints, GraphQL, WebSockets

## Infrastructure & Deployment

- Containerization: e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Nix
- Environment: e.g., Vercel, AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run
- Secret management: e.g., .env files, AWS Secrets Manager
- CI/CD pipelines: Integration and deployment steps that must pass
- Observability: Tools for logging, monitoring, APM, and error tracking

## Third-Party Integrations

- Payments: e.g., Stripe, Lemonsqueezy
- Authentication: e.g., Auth0, Firebase, NextAuth
- AI / LLM Providers: e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- Communication: e.g., Email (Resend), SMS (Twilio), Webhooks
