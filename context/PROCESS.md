# Process Context

Define the workflows, UI/UX guidelines, and quality standards to set boundaries.

## UI / UX Guidelines

- Styling approach: e.g., Tailwind, CSS Modules
- Component library: e.g., Shadcn UI, Headless UI
- Design tokens: e.g., Color palettes, spacing scales
- Accessibility (a11y): e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation
- Responsiveness: e.g., Mobile-first approach, specific breakpoints

## Quality Assurance

- Testing approach: e.g., TDD, unit vs E2E focus
- Coverage goals: e.g., 80% coverage on core logic
- Linting strategy: e.g., ESLint standard rules, Ruff
- Type safety: e.g., Strict TypeScript, Python static typing

## Development Workflow

- Commit rules: e.g., Strict Conventional Commits
- Issue tracking: e.g., Linear, Jira, GitHub Projects
- Version control: e.g., Trunk-based development, GitFlow
- Code review: e.g., Mandatory PR reviews, pair programming

## Code Standards & Conventions

- Code formatting: e.g., Prettier, Black, Biome
- Directory structure: e.g., Feature-sliced design, MVC
- Documentation: e.g., JSDoc, inline comments, README updates
- Naming conventions: e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components
